## Background

Analyze the results of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth that were treated with a variety of drug regimens. More specifically, compare the performance of the company's drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment options.

# Tools Used

* Python
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

# Analysis

* The most effective drug in terms of decreasing tumor volume, limiting metastatic spread and survival rate is Capomulin.
* Mice treated with Infubinol had less tumor growth and metastatic site spread than those treated with Ketapril or placebo, but the mortality rate was higher than the other two.
* Ketapril is less effective at limiting tumor volume and metastatic spread than the placebo in this sample of treated mice.
